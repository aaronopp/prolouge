A simple web app to help Facebook Group Admins create Book Clubs for their group.

There is a front end web react server, and a backend python web server running on flask.
Both will need to be running to use the app. To run the react server, type:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
To start the flask server:
    ```
    cd flask
    python Prologue.py
    ```

Make sure the react server is pointing to the right URL of the flask server!
